## General Info

This is an excercise for practice ECMAScript 6 features like map, filter, reduce and sort (It's mandatory to use them to manipulate arrays). It has empty functions that you should complete and run the tests, you can add parameters. It has a data file that contains songs information and your goal is to pass all tests, you don't have to show anything on the screen.

## Requirements
Fork this repo into your Github account.

## Installation and run tests
- npm install
- npm test

Use the tests/songs.test.js file to know exactly what you are asked to do but don't modify that file. Write your code in the src/song.js file.
